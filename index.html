    <h1 class="heading-general">About me </h1>

      <p> Hello All! My name is Irina, I come from Romania, I moved to the UK few years ago. In January I decided to take the first step in Tech world so I found out about one course - Azure Fundamentals-. I learned a lot of new things about cloud,things that made me want to discover more information related to the cloud architecture, but at that point I wasn't sure which path to choose so my tutor advised me to look for Boot Camp. A friend told me about Code your Future and I decided to look for more information. After doing the Intro Digital Course an idea came across that I should develop these new skills into something more.For me a career in Tech would mean more progression opportunities in my life because the tech industry is evolving and advancing, there is no day without learning something new, so my purpose is to become a full stack developer.</p>

    <br>
    <h1 class="heading-general">Hobbies</h1>
      <p> Leisure time? I do not really have that much, to be honest. My child is still small, and once I come back from work I try to be with him as much as I can.He demands attention, and I try to play with him and answer all his questions, because I know it matters for him. I do not want to say that I do not enjoy my time with him–quite the contrary, it’s great. But it’s not really a leisure time. Anyway, that’s life, I enjoy my role of a mother, and so far I’ve managed to do a good job both as an employee and a family woman but when I get more time I go out with my son and husband to discover new places. Also when the weather doesn't allow us we watch some series or do some games,painting and crafts with our little one.</p>
      <p> I love traveling as travel takes us out of our comfort zones and inspires us to see, taste and try new things. It constantly challenges us, not only to adapt to and explore new surroundings, but also to engage with different people, to embrace adventures as they come and to share new and meaningful experiences with friends and loved ones. In the carousel above you can see pictures of the places I visited, and also the carousel of images is a one of my projects.</p>

    <h1 class="heading-general">Music</h1>
      <p> Music is a part of all of our lives, from when we’re growing up to when we’re old. We grow up to the sound of our
    mothers singing us lullabies so that we’d go to sleep. Music is one of the most calming and soothing things if you let
    it be. It comes from melodies and tunes strung together by people who sing and play musical instruments.</p>

      <p>When we talk about music, we are talking about all the instruments like drums, piano, guitar, etc. and how they get together to make a sound that is pleasing to our ears. We all have some songs we love to sing and dance to, right? Wouldn’t life be a little boring without music? It is something we all need to enjoy our days slightly more than we
    already do because music adds more color to our lives.</p>
